# Clownmeister's Unity essentials

Just some classes I commonly use in Unity. Feel free to explore.

Contains some reusable scripts from my other projects and gamejams. 

I will keep adding more and if it grows a lot I might set up release as unity package.

## Requirements

Tested on Unity 6 but should work on other versions without issues I bet.

## Installation

1) Create ClownMeister folder in your scripts folder in unity project. (optional but works best with Rider IDE namespace hinting)
1) Clone this repository.
1) Done
